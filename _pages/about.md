My broad interests:
- Gameplay Design
- Gameplay Mechanism 
- Computer Graphics


I carry **3 years of work experience** working in game industry, having contributed to the development of [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/), a title that has ascended to the top three in terms of revenue within the current video game market. Presently, I am pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at Northeastern University [Graduating in __July 2024__]. Alongside my academic endeavors, I am also dedicating myself to indie game development. This journey blends the rigor of advanced computer science with the creative challenges of independent game creation, positioning me uniquely in the evolving landscape of video gaming.

Last summer marked a milestone in my journey as an indie game developer with the launch of [One Half](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1998450/_/), my first commercial game, on Steam. The game achieved commercial success, particularly in the East Asia region, capturing the hearts of gamers and carving out a special place within the vibrant indie game landscape.

Currently, my team and I are channeling our passion and creativity into developing two new indie titles!
