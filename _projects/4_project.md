# **DUELALITY**

- **Duelality** is a 2D card game that is built on top of Unity within 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2021.
- The main game loop is a trade off between short time benefits and long term benefits. Player will choose between the one time powerful effect card or the long term benefit card.

## **DEMO**

<!-- MNIST-Muddle (Personal project)

The aim of this project was to get a practical exposure of how Latent Domain works in deep learning. This is a simple project which tries to generate poorly written hand-digits by interpolating between the nearest cluster.
â€‹
Got practical exposure to:
 - Auto Encoders
 - Latent domain
 - PyTorch hosting using Streamlit
 - Project Demo - [Link](https://share.streamlit.io/vdivakar/mnistmuddle/br_streamlit/app.py)
 - GitHub [Link]()
